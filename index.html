            <h3><strong>The Report</strong></h3>
            <p>The Report is a collaborative project I made with some friends. While initially started for a school project, we decided to continue the game further after submitting and see our idea through. My contributions included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>All Music, Sound Effects, & Audio Implementation</li>
                <li>Art Creation</li>
                <li>Programming</li>
            </ul>

            <h3><strong>City Views</strong></h3>
            <p>City Views is a personal project I have been working on for quite a while. The idea behind this game was to create an experience where the player has very limited choices for movement and interaction in the world, and is forced to just sit and watch the world around them. I wanted to challenge myslef to create the game from scratch, working on all the music, art, animations, and game mechanics myself. It is a project I am very proud of, and demonstrates a lot of my skills, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Algorythmic Music Generation</li>
                <li>Animation And Art Skills</li>
                <li>Solo Game Development Skills</li>
            </ul>
