# Miles Berman - Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. Here, you'll find the code and resources for my website where I showcase my projects in game design, programming, art, and music production.

## Overview

The portfolio is a reflection of my work and skills, app programming, game development, music, and more. The site is built to host my work and share it with those interested!

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: The main entry point of the website.
- `assets/`: Contains the stylesheet, images, and other static assets used across the site.
- `portfolio/`: Contains info for each project with resources and some downloadables.

## Contact
