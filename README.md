# Miles Berman - Portfolio

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website. Here, you'll find the code and resources for my website where I showcase my projects in game design, programming, art, and music production.

## Overview

The portfolio is a reflection of my work and skills, app programming, game development, music, and more. The site is built to host my work and share it with those interested!

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- `index.html`: The main entry point of the website.
- `assets/`: Contains the stylesheet, images, and other static assets used across the site.
- `portfolio/`: Contains info for each project with resources and some downloadables.

## Featured Projects

- **City Views**: A personal project where the player experiences limited interaction, emphasizing observation. I challenged myself to create all aspects from scratch.
- **The Report**: A collaborative project that began with friends at UC Santa Cruz. My contributions span across music, sound design, art, and programming.
- **SMPL-HLPR**: An app made in Python for audio manipulation, allowing real-time changes to bit depth, sample rate, and pitch of audio files.
