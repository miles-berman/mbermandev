            <h2>Changing the problem</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">
                As long as our problem remains the same, we can continue to generate new children that will always fit to the
                enviroment problem set. But what if the problem changes? What if we need to go from a unary problem to a binary problem? Or what 
                if we want to just change the number we are looking for?
            </p>

            <h2>Mutation</h2>
            <p class="intro-text">
                The solution to the problem here is mutation. Mutation is the process of changing the data of an
                organism at random. This means that not all new organisms will be the exact same as their parents.
                The hope here is that by spawning a new organism with a random mutation, we can
                prevent being able to change our problem or scope, and continue to evolve our population.
