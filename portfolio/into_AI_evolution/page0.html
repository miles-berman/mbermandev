        <h1>An Intro To AI Using Natural Selection and Mutation</h1>
        <p class="intro-text">An experiment done in attempt showcase AI in a more abstract manner. The idea is that, simply
            through natural selection and mutation, a population of "organisms" can evolve to fit a multitude of problems.

            <h2>An Introduction to The Idea</h2>
            <p>Let's say we have a simple "organism" with data nodes, and some connection between them...</p>
            
            <!-- Image with description -->
            <figure>
                <img src="assets/0/0_connected.png" alt="image a1 (one connection organism)" style="max-width: 57%; height: auto;">
                <figcaption>Basic "organism" with two nodes (neurons) and one connection (synapse): 0-inner</figcaption>
            </figure>
        
            <p>If we go and check the data for our first simple organism here. Asuming a connection (the red line in the diagram)
                flows from the first node to the second node, you can likely guess the data will be a 0.
            </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            <!-- Image with description -->
            <figure>
                <img src="assets/0/1_connected.png" alt="image a2 (one connection organism)" style="max-width: 57%; height: auto;">
                <figcaption>Basic "organism" with two nodes (neurons) and one connection (synapse): 1-inner</figcaption>
            </figure>
        
            <p>Likewise, if we were to check the data of this second organism, we would find that the data is a 1. </p>
            <br>
            <br>
            <br>

            <!-- Image with description -->
            <figure>
                <img src="assets/0/no_connected1.png" alt="image a3 (one connection organism)" style="max-width: 57%; height: auto;">
                <figcaption>Basic "organism" with two nodes (neurons) and one connection (synapse): 0-1</figcaption>
            </figure>
        
            <p>So what about here? The inner node has no connections to either of the numbers, and they connect themselves. It is important to note here that these connections
                are still only one way. This means that either 0 can flow forward to the 1, or 1 can flow forward to the 0, but they cannot flow both ways without more connections. What happens here can be interesting, especially when
                you concider it in the context of how you want your organisms to behave.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>If you set up your networks in such a way, you can actually make nodes ovverride the other, and in a sense, "learn" from the other. The data is passed through the network, and the
                inner node can change the data to be whatever it wants. This would mean the skipping of the inner node would still produce a 0 or 1, and is still depending on the flow of the data.
                This of course means if you needed the data to be processed further by the inner node, you would have to make sure the data is passed through in a different way.
            </p>
